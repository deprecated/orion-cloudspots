The dark regions in Orion

* History
+ Bob O'Dell first identified the "Geheimnis" region in Orion S
  + ODell:2000a is the first mention I think
    + HIGH ANGULAR RESOLUTION DETERMINATION OF EXTINCTION IN THE ORION NEBULA
    + C. R. O'DELL and F. YUSEF-ZADEH
    + Although actually, there seems to be earlier history too
  + Geheimnis is german for "secret", "mystery"
  + https://www.linguee.de/deutsch-englisch/uebersetzung/geheimnis.html
  + In paper it is referred to as the "Unusual Dark Arc"
    + See sec 4.7 of ODell:2000a
  + The interpretation given is that it is 
    : a sharp lip tilting toward the observer on the side close to h1 Ori C, then abruptly dropping.
  + My objection to this interpretation is that no bright ionization front is evident
+ My first work on it was presented in Star Formation Workshop 2005
  + /I think, although there is evidence it was earlier (see below)/
  + [[file:~/Dropbox/Presentations/Poland2012/oldtalks/SF05-wjh-talk.pdf]]
  + I identified the following
    + Dark snake
    + Bright snake
    + Shadow (Geheimnis region)
  + I suggested the shadow was the literal shadow of the Bright snake (what Garcia-Diaz:2007a call the "SW compact bar")
    + However I now think that was wrong
  + I showed an analog model with the sun projecting the shadow of a stick onto a curved surface (poster tube)




* Possible models
+ Initially copied over from [[file:~/Dropbox/RadioProplyds/jan-forbrich-2016.org][file:~/Dropbox/RadioProplyds/jan-forbrich-2016.org]]
** Ionization shadows
+ Possibly works for Dark Arc
  + Obstacle is filament near LV4, 5, 6
  + This filament seems to be composed of multiple overlapping arcs
+ But hard to find obstacles for all the regions
+ Shadows of photoionized jets
  + Looks like corkscrew jet (driver of HH 529) and its extension to W both might have twisty thin shadows
+ Shadows of clumpy bow shocks
  + This could explain the nostril region beyond HH 528
** Magnetic pressure
+ Analog to sunspots
+ Should have B \approx (8 \pi P)^{1/2  }
  + P = 2 n k T \approx 2.761-8 N_4 dyn
  + B = 4.7e-4 G = 470 N_4^0.5 \mu{}G
  + Where N_4 is the ambient density in units of 10^4 cm^-3
  + (Note, the density within the cloudspot will be lower)
+ This is 10 times higher than the magnetic field in the Veil
  + But maybe could be from a molecular filament and has somehow leaked out in a magnetic arc or something
+ Comparison with our radiation-MHD simulations
  + Henney:2009a, Arthur:2011a
  + In the globule simulations, we get similar streamers to what is seen in Carina
  + In the turbulence simulations, not so much.  This is probably due to insufficient resolution.  But perhaps also the magnetic field is not strong enough
** Ram pressure
+ bowshock tails can't work because radial from th1C so ionizing photons run down the empty channels and would produce bright emission at the end
+ 3-wind interaction plume could work
  + This is where the hot wind is channeled
  + But do we have enough proplyds?

** Fossil cavities of molecular outflows
+ Explains association with cavity in Carina
+ Also HH 625
+ We have hundreds of high velocity flows
  + Some of them are coming from exposed proplyds, but some of them must be coming from embedded sources
  + Work out kinematical ages, and then work out how long a fossil cavity would stay around, so we can get a multiplier to how many of those there might be
  + And even the ones that start from proplyds might be able to punch there way into the molecular cloud if they are powerful enough (or maybe not)
*** Filling-in of a fossil cavity
+ Assume we have a jet cavity, of size less than the thickness of the ionized layer
+ What would happen to it when the jet turns off?
  + 
* Clues from scattered light and diagnostic ratios
+ Spots show up in [N II] 5755/6583 ratio as low-temperature
+ They also show up in [S II] 6716/6731 ratio as low-density regions
+ So definitely not in pressure balance
  + But then we see a positive correlation between n and T in general in the nebula
+ The Dark Arc does not show strongly in the scattered light images
  + The upper sharp edge is not visible at all
  + But there is some bright scattered light at the lower edge
+ Other regions, such as HH 625 do show as dark in scattered light
+ Still others have a sort of mirroring morphology, where they show some dark morphology, but it is shifted and expanded with respect to what is seen in ionized lines
  + For instance, the Dark Duck and Bat
+ So this is evidence for two different types of cloud spot
  1. Scattering-dark spots, which are real holes
     - These are also seen in fluorescent O I
     - And in the Raman wings
     - And in IRAC bands too
     - Another example is the Dark Snake very close to the Trapezium
  2. Scattering-invisible spots, which are ionization shadows
     - These are better-defined in higher-ionization lines, as with the upper edge of the Dark Arc. 
* Useful images

** Orion S WFC3 [S II]-[N II]-[O III]
#+attr_html: :width 500
[[file:full_RGB.jpg]]
+ More images with WFC3, including [O II] from John Bally's more recent observations are in this ds9 backup set:
  + [[file:trapezium-wfc3-2018-10-30.bck]]
* Inventory of Geheimnis regions
1. The dark arc - the classic prototype
2. The bat-and-duck - smaller region similar to dark arc, just to the S
3. The dark snake - weird filament that for a long time I thought must be an internal extinction filament
4. HH 625 (see below)
   [[file:hh-625.png]]
   + This has a dark region (with swirly bits) inside an emission filament that is moving
5. Little paw prints
   - to the east of HH 625
   - low contrast and often showing symmetrical placing
   - This is a zoom of the WFC3 field with enhanced contrast
     [[file:little-pawprints.png]]
   - Also patterns that look like a skull, a moustache, etc!
6. Lots more fainter small features all around the Orion S region
7. The "nostrils" beyond HH528
   - These look like they might be shadows of knots in the HH 528 bow shock
8. Dark lanes in the Big Arc and round about

* Line ratios
+ I was going to measure these on the MUSE images, but that will have to be another day
+ The data is on the external SSD
+ The ds9 backup file is
  + [[file:/Volumes/SSD-1TB/OrionMuse/LineMaps/multiple-maps-2018-10-27.bck]]


* Other questions
+ Are they seen in other H II regions?
  + Look at HST images of Carina, of Lagoon
  + *Yes*, Lagoon definitely has them in hourglass region
    #+attr_html: :width 500
    [[file:m8-dark-spots.png]]
    + See [[file:~/Dropbox/Presentations/Olympia2014/figs/lagoon/lagoon-fact.org][file:~/Dropbox/Presentations/Olympia2014/figs/lagoon/lagoon-fact.org]]
    + distance 1.25 kpc
    + dominated by Herschel 36 (O7)
      + even though the region as a whole is dominated by O4 star

  + *Also* Carina shows similar features
    + Hairy ball (my name)
      [[file:carina-hairy-ball.png]]

    + Mystic Mountain (not my name)

      [[file:carina-dark-arc-clone.png]]
      + https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1007b/


+ What is the relation with strange object HH 625?
  + This has very similar dark regions in it
  + See Sec 4.6 of ODell:2015a
  + Has high proper motion and blue-shifted radial velocity
    + But not that much: V_t = 30, V_r = -36 wrt mol cloud




* The texture of cloud spots
+ Contrast in Ha is 30% for the Dark Arc, but can be <5% for fainter small features

    

* Comparison with other dark features

+ In order to reinforce the fact that they cannot be extinction features, we can compare with:
  1. Foreground extinction clouds, such as SW cloud and the finger near it
     - Show reddening
     - Not seen in radio
     - Wispy, filamentary morphology
