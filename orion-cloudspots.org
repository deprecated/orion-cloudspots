The dark regions in Orion

* History
+ Bob O'Dell first identified the "Geheimnis" region in Orion S
  + ODell:2000a is the first mention I think
    + HIGH ANGULAR RESOLUTION DETERMINATION OF EXTINCTION IN THE ORION NEBULA
    + C. R. O'DELL and F. YUSEF-ZADEH
    + Although actually, there seems to be earlier history too
  + Geheimnis is german for "secret", "mystery"
  + https://www.linguee.de/deutsch-englisch/uebersetzung/geheimnis.html
  + In paper it is referred to as the "Unusual Dark Arc"
    + See sec 4.7 of ODell:2000a
  + The interpretation given is that it is 
    : a sharp lip tilting toward the observer on the side close to h1 Ori C, then abruptly dropping.
  + My objection to this interpretation is that no bright ionization front is evident
+ My first work on it was presented in Star Formation Workshop 2005
  + /I think, although there is evidence it was earlier (see below)/
  + [[file:~/Dropbox/Presentations/Poland2012/oldtalks/SF05-wjh-talk.pdf]]
  + I identified the following
    + Dark snake
    + Bright snake
    + Shadow (Geheimnis region)
  + I suggested the shadow was the literal shadow of the Bright snake (what Garcia-Diaz:2007a call the "SW compact bar")
    + However I now think that was wrong
  + I showed an analog model with the sun projecting the shadow of a stick onto a curved surface (poster tube)




* Possible models
+ Initially copied over from [[file:~/Dropbox/RadioProplyds/jan-forbrich-2016.org][file:~/Dropbox/RadioProplyds/jan-forbrich-2016.org]]
** Ionization shadows
+ Possibly works for Dark Arc
  + Obstacle is filament near LV4, 5, 6
+ But hard to find obstacles for all the regions
** Magnetic pressure
+ Analog to sunspots
+ Should have B \approx (8 \pi P)^{1/2  }
  + P = 2 n k T \approx 2.761-8 N_4 dyn
  + B = 4.7e-4 G = 470 N_4^0.5 \mu{}G
  + Where N_4 is the ambient density in units of 10^4 cm^-3
  + (Note, the density within the cloudspot will be lower)
+ This is 10 times higher than the magnetic field in the Veil
  + But maybe could be from a molecular filament and has somehow leaked out in a magnetic arc or something
** Ram pressure
+ bowshock tails can't work because radial from th1C so ionizing photons run down the empty channels and would produce bright emission at the end
+ 3-wind interaction plume could work
  + This is where the hot wind is channeled
  + But do we have enough proplyds?

* Useful images

** Orion S WFC3 [S II]-[N II]-[O III]

* Inventory of Geheimnis regions
1. The dark arc - the classic prototype
2. The bat-and-duck - smaller region similar to dark arc, just to the S
3. The dark snake - weird filament that for a long time I thought must be an internal extinction filament

* Line ratios
+ I was going to measure these on the MUSE images, but that will have to be another day
+ The data is on the external SSD
+ The ds9 backup file is
