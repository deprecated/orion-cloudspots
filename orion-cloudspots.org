The dark regions in Orion

* History
+ Bob O'Dell first identified the "Geheimnis" region in Orion S
  + ODell:2000a is the first mention I think
    + HIGH ANGULAR RESOLUTION DETERMINATION OF EXTINCTION IN THE ORION NEBULA
    + C. R. O'DELL and F. YUSEF-ZADEH
    + Although actually, there seems to be earlier history too
  + Geheimnis is german for "secret", "mystery"
  + https://www.linguee.de/deutsch-englisch/uebersetzung/geheimnis.html
  + In paper it is referred to as the "Unusual Dark Arc"
    + See sec 4.7 of ODell:2000a
  + The interpretation given is that it is 
    : a sharp lip tilting toward the observer on the side close to h1 Ori C, then abruptly dropping.
  + My objection to this interpretation is that no bright ionization front is evident
+ My first work on it was presented in Star Formation Workshop 2005
  + /I think, although there is evidence it was earlier (see below)/
  + [[file:~/Dropbox/Presentations/Poland2012/oldtalks/SF05-wjh-talk.pdf]]
  + I identified the following
    + Dark snake
    + Bright snake
    + Shadow (Geheimnis region)
  + I suggested the shadow was the literal shadow of the Bright snake (what Garcia-Diaz:2007a call the "SW compact bar")
    + However I now think that was wrong
  + I showed an analog model with the sun projecting the shadow of a stick onto a curved surface (poster tube)

2. The bat-and-duck - smaller region similar to dark arc, just to the S

* Line ratios
+ I was going to measure these on the MUSE images, but that will have to be another day
